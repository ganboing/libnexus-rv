# Decoder/Encoder Library for RISC-V Nexus Trace

This library implements the decoder/encoder(TODO) of RISC-V Nexus Trace (1.0 Ratified spec).
It's inspired by the [Reference Code](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/tg-nexus-trace/tree/1.0_Ratified/refcode/c).
Compared to the reference code, it abstracts Nexus Messages into C structures for easier interface with C/C++.
More Documentation coming soon.
